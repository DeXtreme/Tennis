The Tennis Court Booking System is a web-based application designed to
facilitate the management of bookings for a tennis court. It allows users to schedule court
reservations, receive notifications about their bookings, and enables administrators to
oversee the booking process. Additionally, the system notifies designated workers to clean
the court after each game session.
